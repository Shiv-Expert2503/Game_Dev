# Project Title: Advanced 3-D Hand Tracking Module

## Description:
Revolutionize hand tracking without the need for expensive 3-D devices like Leap Motion. Our cutting-edge project leverages the power of computer vision through MediaPipe, enabling precise [x, y, z] coordinate capture using just a standard 2-D webcam. Why invest in costly hardware when our solution provides comparable accuracy?

## Key Features:

1. Cost-Efficiency: Eliminate the financial barrier associated with high-end 3-D tracking devices.

2. Webcam Compatibility: Utilize your existing 2-D webcam to seamlessly capture three-dimensional hand coordinates.

3. MediaPipe Integration: Leverage the robust capabilities of MediaPipe for accurate and efficient hand tracking.

## Versatile Functions:

1. Real-time Tracking: Track hand movements in real-time, ensuring responsiveness and precision.
Dynamic Line Drawing: Enhance user experience by dynamically drawing lines on tracked hands, providing a visual representation of movement.
Advantages:

2. Accessible Technology: Make 3-D hand tracking accessible to a wider audience without the need for specialized hardware.

3. Open-Source: Foster collaboration and innovation by providing an open-source solution that encourages community involvement.

## How it Works:
Our module employs advanced computer vision algorithms, integrating seamlessly with MediaPipe to capture and interpret hand movements. The result is a cost-effective, webcam-based 3-D hand tracking solution that brings a new level of accessibility to this technology.

## Ideal for:

Developers: Integrate our module into your projects without the expense of dedicated 3-D tracking hardware.

Enthusiasts: Explore the world of 3-D hand tracking without breaking the bank.

## Functions Available:-

It detects the hand at 21 points.
These 21 points are called landmarks. And each landmark has its importance!

The detected coordinates of the hand are then passed to unity using UDP protocol for minimal latency.
And in Unity we can do exciting things with the received coordinates. 
1. Find Hands
2. Get LandMarks

## What we Can do is:

1. Can create our own environment and play with it.
2. Make 3-D objects that can be accessed by our hands.
3. Can create a 3-D Game. But that is something related to Game development.
